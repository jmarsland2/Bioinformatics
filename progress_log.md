# Bioinformatics Learning Progress

## February 23, 2025
### Completed Today:
1. Practiced and learned python skills
2. Set up Github Repository
2. Installed RDKit & Verified Setup
3. Learned and wrote python scripts to describe molecular properties
4. Pushed first cheminformatics script to Github
5. Next: Work on handling molecular datasets with RDKit and Pandas

## February 24, 2025
### Completed Today:
- Collected bioactivity data for **EGFR inhibitors** from **ChEMBL** (`CHEMBL203`).
- Extracted **SMILES**, **IC50 values**, and **bioactivity classifications**.
- Processed molecular data for future **machine learning & cheminformatics analysis**.
- Generated **molecule visualizations** and saved them into a **PDF report**.

### Next Steps:
- Clean & preprocess **IC50 data** (remove duplicates, standardize values).
- Convert **SMILES to molecular fingerprints** for ML feature engineering.
- Train a basic **machine learning model to predict IC50** (Random Forest / XGBoost).
- Perform **molecular docking** using **AutoDock or RDKit docking**.
